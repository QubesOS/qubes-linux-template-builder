The Template Builder
======================

1) First, create a clean image of Fedora Linux install. You can use the fedoraize_image
script for this:

fedorize_image <image> <file-with-packets-lists>

NOTE: The fedorize_image script can be also used to update an image -- it
automatically assumes the update mode if the <image> already exists.

2) Update symlinks in rpms_to_install/ using the create_symlinks_in_rpms_to_install_dir.sh script. The script
reads the core, gui, and xen packages versions from version_{core,gui,xen} files and creates appropriate symlinks
in rpms_to_install/ dir.

Verify that all symlinks are correct.

3) Now, you can "qubeize" the image. This must be done as root. E.g.:

# ./qubeize_image <img> <template-name>

4) Finally, build the Template RPM (do it as normal user, not root), e.g.: 

$./build_rpm <name>

The resulting rpm is stored in rpm/noarch directory.
